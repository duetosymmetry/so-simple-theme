# Questions

Before the workshop, a number of the participants brainstormed some
topics for discussion.

## Effective Field Theory
* In what types of physical situations is EFT valid?
* Are we guaranteed that an EFT treatment is appropriate for
  gravity?
* Is physics in the IR/UV of some theory sensitive/insensitive to
  the opposite regime?
* Are there theories in which the IR/UV somehow “mix” and affect
  physics in the opposite regime?
* I like this line of questioning. I have some examples of
  gravitational “theories” that exhibit UV/IR mixing, and
  potentially defy the EFT dictum.

## Cosmological frameworks / parametrizations
* Can PPF (Friedmannian) or other cosmological parametrizations be
  extended into the non-linear regime? Or would this miss out lots
  of relevant physics/terms?
* Are perturbative approaches like “EFT of Large Scale Structure”
  helpful in connecting large and small scales?
* What is the relationship between parameterizations and screening
  effects?
* What are the best variables to use in an EFT-of-DE-like framework?
  Can one generalize the variables in
  [[1404.3713]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3713) to other regimes?

## PPN and PPK frameworks
* What are the assumptions behind PPN?
* Does it work around curved background (like FLRW)?
* Is PPK an extension of PPN?
* Is there a way to deal with screening?
* How are violations of the equivalence principle encoded?

## PPE framework
* Does PPE include screening?
* More about gravitational waves in general: can modified gravity
  have effects on large scale (i.e. not necessarily at the source,
  but more during the propagation)?

## Bumpy black holes
* Can we get BH solution in scalar tensor theories such as
  Horndeski’s? Even around FLRW?
* How dependent are bumpy BH solutions on assumptions about the
  boundary conditions of the spacetime? What do they look like if
  embedded in expanding spacetimes?
* Are there observable signatures of firewalls/fuzzballs, e.g. in
  gravitational wave data?

## Cosmological observables
* Of all the typical cosmological signatures of modified gravity
  (RSD, cosmic shear, cluster/void lensing, etc), which stand the
  best chance of being detected? Which possess the most
  discriminatory power (e.g. distinguish between different screening
  mechanisms)?
* Do any cosmological observables probe aspects of theories that are
  also interesting to compact object people? For example, would a
  detection of Lorentz violation on cosmological scales also have
  implications for (e.g.) BH stuff? Would the discovery of a
  background scalar field (quintessence etc.) be important to scalar
  no-hair calculations? Or are the distance scales so far apart that
  the theoretical implications aren’t really connected?

## Screening effects
* Departures from spherical symmetry - still not well understood?
* Is it possible to make a parametrisation of screening mechanisms?
* How does screening work inside composite objects like galaxies? If
  the galaxy is screened, does that mean everything inside the
  galaxy is also screened?
* Do screening mechanisms that rely on spontaneous symmetry breaking
  produce topological defects or other exotic objects?
* Can PPN/PPK/PPF/EFT/etc. parameters be related to any properties
  of screening mechanisms? Or does screening depend on essentially
  different properties of the relevant theories?
* Vainshtein mechanism in curved ST (i.e. broken Galilean symmetry)?
* The current status of N-body cosmological simulations of non-GR
  theories, and their importance in understanding screening effects
  on structure formation.
* I would personally be interested in a (quick) review on the
  different screening mechanisms.

## Proposed overlap scenarios
* Can we trace violations of the equivalence principle throughout
  different scales?
* Brown dwarfs could be good candidates for overlap as the screening
  effects might not be as efficient there.
* Can the dynamics of stars in galaxies be treated using a PPN
  approach?
* Can the dynamics of galaxies in clusters be treated using a PPN
  approach?
* Can the dynamics of galaxies in clusters be treated using a
  PPF/EFT approach?
* The necessity to embed non-linear structures in a FLRW spacetime
  can put strong conditions on alternative theories of gravity in
  cosmology (e.g. see
  [[1404.3713]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06678)). Do similar
  things apply for compact objects (e.g. bumpy BHs must be embedded
  in some background)?
* Gravitational waves are caused by the merging of compact objects,
  but travel over cosmological distances before being detected. They
  are therefore sensitive to modifications of GR in both the strong
  gravity and cosmological regimes. Is this useful for connecting
  the two? Or do we have to use two separate parameterizations at
  once!? Are there degeneracies between the cosmological/PPF and PPE
  parameters?
* Some details of large-scale structure formation depend on
  “feedback mechanisms” such as the injection of energy into the
  ISM/IGM by SMBHs at the centre of galaxies. Could modifications to
  GR affect the SMBH drastically enough to alter the energy
  injection, and thus impact some large-scale observables too?

## Theoretical motivations to modify GR
* Cosmological Constant Problem
  * Can modifying GR address the cosmological constant problem(s)?
  * If so, can such modifications be tested in Cosmology, Black
    Holes, Neutron Stars, etc.?
  * Can we test how/if quantum vacuum gravitates?
  * Can Dark Energy couple to Black Holes?
  * Gravitational theories can be constructed that are similar
    (observationally) to GR, except that they are technically
    natural/degravitate
* Black Hole Information Paradox
  * Can tests of BH physics (e.g. GW’s from BH mergers) shed light
    on the BH information paradox/ firewall controversy? Niayesh
* Quantum gravity
  * Do some aspects of QG theories (e.g. extra dimensions) suggest
    certain modifications to GR?
  * Can modifications to GR be introduced to enable (e.g.)
    renormalizability or other properties desirable for unifying
    gravity with the standard model of particle physics?
* Are there any shared motivations between the cosmological and
  compact object communities?
